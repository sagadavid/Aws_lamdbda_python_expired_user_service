Task : Service Design

Task definition
Moso is using AWS. Create a lambda code which
•	Checks database for user who didn’t login for 1 month
•	Warn them with their registered emails that if they do not login within a week their user profiles would be deleted.
•	And do so, delete user and save deleted user profile logs.
•	User should be informed on deletion

Steps-Subs

1-	Create WarnedUser with warningDate
a.	Id:PK : auto-increment
b.	UUID : VarChar
c.	Warning_Date : DateTime
d.	isWarned: Boolean
e.	isDeleted: Boolean
f.	Deletion_Date : DateTime
g.	Last_login
h.	Email

2-	Select expiring users
a.	Needed Columns from master table:
i.	Uuid : VarChar
ii.	Email : VarChar
iii.	Last_login : DateTime
b.	Meet condition : Last_login <= DATE_SUB(NOW(), INTERVAL 11 Months)

3-	Get data from master table
a.	Response = list of user objects

4-For each expiry in expiry_user_objects;

Check if
expiry exists in the warned_users table in the moso database,
And isMailed true a week ago,
then,
Delete user from the users table in the moso database,
And,
Set isDeleted true in the warned_users table,

#isMailed:false|empty, then,
Send an email to the user,
use the registered mail in the warned_users table,
and say that “your moso account is passive for a time please take action an log into your account in a week. Otherwise your account will be deleted permanently”,
And,
set isMailed to true,
And,
register the mail sending date to the mail_date column I	in the warned_users table in the moso database,

On the other hand, expiry is mailed but it was less then a week ago,
do nothing, just skip,

If expiry does not exist in the warned_users table,
Save non existence element to warned_users table as a new row
And, Then do as in ‘If #isMailed:false|empty’.
